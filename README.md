# Kanban Task Management App

A simple, interactive task management application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to organize their tasks in a Kanban-style interface, with draggable, editable, and deletable tasks. The app supports three sections:

- **To Do**
- **Doing**
- **Done**

Tasks can be added, moved between sections, and saved in local storage to persist across sessions.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can input new tasks into the "To Do" section.
- **Move Tasks**: Tasks can be moved between "To Do," "Doing," and "Done" using drag-and-drop functionality or by clicking on the task to change its status.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be deleted by clicking the delete icon (`×`).
- **Mark Tasks as Done**: Click on a task to mark it as completed and move it to the "Done" section.
- **Task Editing**: Double-click on any task to edit its text.
- **Sort Tasks**: Sort tasks by alphabetical order, check status, or by the date added.
- **Persistent Storage**: All tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage to persist between page reloads.
- **Clear All Tasks**: Clear all tasks from the app and local storage.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality, including adding, moving, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as saving tasks to local storage.
- **LocalStorage**: To save the tasks data in the browser so that tasks persist across sessions.
